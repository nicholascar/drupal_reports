The following is a step by step guide on how to install the drupal report generation website.
The easiest way to do this is with drush so the instructions will be written assuming drush is used.
First the instruction will be written then the drush command

1. Install the features module (drush en features -y)
2. copy over 'tableofcontents' , 'datasetSource' to site/all/modules
3. install and enable zen. (drush en zen -y)
4. copy over csiro_internal_theme to site/all/themes
5. Install the references module (drush en references -y)
6. install the display suite module (drush en ds -y)
7. copy over the 'report_generation' folder to site/all_modules.
8. Install the report generation feature (drush en report_generation -y)
9. The site is now completly installed with two exceptions: 
   - The report nodes examples need to be assigned report elements in list of reports or 
     remove them completly. 
   -  The display suite settings didn't transfer over. This module configures how a node is
      displayed with what content goes where. For example the source of the table will be below the
      table instead of above it. To resolve this issue go to admin/structure/ds and adjust each
      node's display indvidually. The layout for each report element is as follows: 

- before you can do this you need to change the layout once you're in the node's display settings. 
Change -None- to Fluid two column stacked. Then put all the content in the header and remove the 
undesired ones. 

-          table

   o   caption (above the table)
   o   table data
   o   Source
   o   Put a 'Read more' field below the table that will link to the node.


-          figure

   o   Image
   o   caption
   o   Put a 'Read more' field below the figure that will link to the node.

-          paragraph

   o   title – above the paragraph text
   o   Put a 'Read more' field below the title that will link to the node.

-          Cover Page

   o   Header
   o   Date
   o   Sub Heading
   o   Party Involved

Note: If the css needs changing adjust it in the CSIRO theme under report.css
